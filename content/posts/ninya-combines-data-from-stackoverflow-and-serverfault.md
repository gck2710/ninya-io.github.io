We've been hard at work here to get a new exciting feature done. [ninya.io](http://www.ninya.io) is all about making interesting people in tech more discoverable.
[ninya.io](http://www.ninya.io) let's you search for skilled tech people based on locations and skills. So far, the only data source we hooked up to was [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com).

We are pleased to announce that from now on you'll start seeing mixed result sets with users from [ServerFault](http://www.serverfault.com) also being considered for your search requests.

Both platforms serve overlapping needs so a mashup comes naturally. For instance you might expect users proficient in Apache or Nginx stuff on both sites.

We added a small icon to the upper right corner of the user to indicate the platform where the user lives on. You can also click on it to directly jump to the user's profile page on that site.

### Where do we go from here? Is this an attempt to mash up all StackExchange sites?

It's not! We mash up sources which we feel are a good fit for [ninya.io](http://www.ninya.io). While adding further StackExchange sites is a very simple and scalable
process now, we believe there are other great candidates to be added, too ;-) The main challenge is to make users from different sites with different
reputation systems somewhat comparable.

Stay tuned.
